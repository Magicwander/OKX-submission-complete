## 🔧 CRITICAL FIXES IMPLEMENTED

### 1. Authority Validation Issues (RESOLVED)
- **Problem:** Authority mismatch in UpdatePrice instruction tests
- **Solution:** Fixed mock account creation to use consistent authority
- **Result:** All authority validation tests now passing

### 2. Price Update Processing (RESOLVED)
- **Problem:** `mockAccount.currentPrice.equals is not a function`
- **Solution:** Fixed to access `mockAccount.currentPrice.price.equals()`
- **Result:** Price update processing test now passing

### 3. Borsh Schema Validation (RESOLVED)
- **Problem:** Map-based schema causing validation errors
- **Solution:** Converted to object-based Borsh schema format
- **Result:** All serialization tests passing

### 4. BigInt Serialization (RESOLVED)
- **Problem:** BigInt comparison and serialization issues
- **Solution:** Proper BigInt handling for slot and timestamp
- **Result:** All BigInt-related tests passing

### 5. Wallet Initialization (RESOLVED)
- **Problem:** Wallet validation errors in system tests
- **Solution:** Added proper wallet setup with Keypair.generate()
- **Result:** All wallet-related tests passing
